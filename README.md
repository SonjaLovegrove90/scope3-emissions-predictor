# 📘 Scope 3 Emissions Prediction Platform

This repository contains the full implementation of a machine learning platform developed for my MSc Dissertation: **Predicting Scope 3 Emissions Using Machine Learning on ERP-style Data**.

The project includes data preprocessing, model training, SHAP-based explainability, and a user-facing interface built with Voila.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Scope 3 emissions are notoriously hard to measure, relying heavily on upstream and downstream supplier data. This platform demonstrates how machine learning, using ERP-style inputs, can provide fast, explainable estimates of product-level emissions.

**Core components:**
- 🧼 Structured preprocessing pipeline with encoding, transformation, and feature engineering
- ⚙️ XGBoost model for emissions prediction (with cross-validation)
- 📊 SHAP integration for interpretability
- 🖥️ Interactive UI built using Voila (Jupyter Widgets)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔧 1. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you're using `ipywidgets==7.7.2` for Voila compatibility.

### 🧠 2. Train the Model
```bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### 🔍 3. Generate SHAP Explanations (optional)
```bash
python scripts/shap_explainer.py
```

### 🖥️ 4. Launch the UI
```bash
voila notebooks/scope3_voila_ui_dropdowns.ipynb
```
